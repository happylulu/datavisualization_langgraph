1. Introduction: This section will introduce the research topic, outline the significance of studying NSCLC clinical trials, and present the research objectives and hypotheses.
2. Hypotheses: Clearly state the research hypotheses, including the impact of treatment arms on tumor measurement reduction and the predictive modeling of progression-free survival (PFS) using patient demographics and clinical features.
3. Methodology: Detail the data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Describe the selection of features and target variables for modeling.
4. Results: Present the outcomes of the statistical analysis and predictive modeling, including evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for the regression model. Include visualizations such as the distribution of tumor measurements across treatment arms and predicted vs. actual PFS values.
5. Discussion: Interpret the results, discussing the implications of the findings on NSCLC treatment and patient outcomes. Highlight the significance of the predictive model and its potential applications in clinical settings.
6. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings, their relevance to the research objectives, and potential future research directions.
7. References: List all sources cited throughout the report in APA style, ensuring that all findings are supported by evidence.
